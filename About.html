						ABOUT WEBSITE
					</div>
					<p> 
						Well, this is me, This website was created by me as part of an assignment for the course Web Programming. I had an interest in 
						computers since high school, not web design specifically but writing logic to solve problems like the fibonacci series
						seemed more interesting than biology or history to me. Later on, I developed an interest in designing websites since it seemed easy and fun
						and here I am now. Apart from academics my interests lie in sports, especially soccer. My friends often describe me as a huge foodie.
